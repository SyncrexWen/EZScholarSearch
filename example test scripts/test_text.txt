Achilles tendinopathy is a common overuse injury affecting the ankle and foot. It manifests as a clinical condition that includes pain, edema, and decreased functionality. This condition can be broadly categorized into two main types based on anatomical location: insertional and noninsertional tendinopathy. The development of Achilles tendinopathy involves various factors, both internal and external. Patients with Achilles tendinopathy often experience stiffness worsened by prolonged rest, and pain exacerbated by physical activity. These symptoms can limit work activity and sports participation, with many patients facing discomfort while wearing shoes due to heel sensitivity. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, although MRI and ultrasound imaging can aid in differential diagnosis. Identifying risk factors and understanding the patient's biomechanics assist in accurate diagnosis and subsequent management. Management of Achilles tendinopathy involves a range of conservative and surgical options. However, due to varying results in clinical studies, a definitive gold standard treatment has not emerged. Eccentric exercises are a valuable tool in managing the condition. The recommend treatments such as shock wave therapy or nitric oxide patches are sought if symptoms do not improve. Peritendinous injections could be options if physical therapy proves ineffective. Surgical intervention is required after six months of conservative treatment. Recent research on Achilles tendinopathy emphasizes the need for individualized treatment plans that address its multifaceted nature. Combining biomechanical analysis, advanced imaging, and patient-specific factors is key to achieving optimal outcomes. Additionally, preventive strategies focusing on proper training techniques, load management, and addressing modifiable risk factors play a critical role in reducing the incidence of this condition. In conclusion, this article provides a current overview of Achilles tendinopathy. It highlights the importance of a comprehensive approach to understanding its causes, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management strategies.
